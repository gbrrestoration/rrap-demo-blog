<p>The Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP) is a collaboration of Australia’s leading experts to create a suite of innovative and targeted measures to help preserve and restore the Great Barrier Reef. These interventions must have strong potential for positive impact, be socially and culturally acceptable, ecologically-sound, ethical and financially responsible. They would be implemented if, when and where it is decided action is needed – and only after rigorous assessment and testing.
